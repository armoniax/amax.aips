# Armonia Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [AIP-1](AIPs/aip-1.md) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed first.

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to Armonia Multichain Platform. It contains:

- The [AIP status page](https://aips.armoniax.org), tracking protocols for Armonia clients and applications
- The [process document](https://aips.armoniax.org/AIPS/aip-1) that governs how protocols are published here

For help *implementing* an AIP, please visit [Armonia Stack Exchange](https://armoniax.stackexchange.com).

## Mission

The goal of the AIP project is to document standardized protocols for Armonia Multichain clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.
