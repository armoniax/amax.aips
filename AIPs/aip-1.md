## What is an AIP?

AIP stands for Armonia Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a design document providing information to the Armonia community, or describing a new feature for Armonia or its processes or environment. The AIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## AIP Rationale

We intend AIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Armonia. Because the AIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For Armonia implementers, AIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the AIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
